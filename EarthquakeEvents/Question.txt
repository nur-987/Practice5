 Write a program with the following specifications:
 - A main class which subscribes to an event called "Alert". 
	On recieving an alert it can notify the users with a text output.
 
 - A class called Earthquake which captures the intensity of the earthquake and the place of occurance.
 - Additionally we have another class called Tsunami which has one member probability of tsunami

Once you create an earthquake object you have to pass the "Place" and intensity information to the class
The earthquake class then creates a Tsunami object and calls the member "CalculateTsunamiProbability"
The probability of  a Tsunami is calculated by the formula "P(T) = I(E)*0.7 + 0.3 * RandomOccuranceChance" 
I(E) - Denotes the intensity of an earthquake. 
The Tsunami class will notify its subscribers regarding the proability of a tsunami. The main class will display it.
